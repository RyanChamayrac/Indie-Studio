# Indie Studio

Here is my second year Year-End group project at Epitech Nice. This a Bomberman programmed in C++ using Irrlicht library for graphics and 3D models, and SFML library for audio. 


# Requirements

First you will need to download packages for Irrlicht and SFML libraries : 

Ubuntu :
	
```
sudo apt-get install libirrlicht-dev
```
```
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```

# Build

First you have to generate the Makefile using **CMake** : 
```
cmake ./CMakeLists.txt
```

Then you have to compile simply using **make** :
```
make
```

You know have access to the binary which you can **launch** like this :
```
./bomberman
```
